A) Copy the optimal controller python file (Yiming translated this from Matlab to Python in the summer, and Jason finished it) into this directory




B) Finish the python file to interface with the crazy flies

For example, see "Figure 8.py"


The python file should do the following:

0) Hardcode in final formation positions. For example, p1 = [0, 0], p2 = [1, 0], p3 = [1, 1]. This is at the top of the file. Also define some time, like 10 seconds.
1) Initialize the crazyflies we're using
2) Get trajectory coefficients from the optimal controller (x, y. We can set z and yaw coefficients to zero for now)
3) Use uav_trajectory.py's buildTrajectories command (pass in the coefficients as a list. they should be formatted the same way as the figure 8 csv file). Here we will only have a single row, because we're following a single curve.
4) Upload the trajectories to each of the crazyflies
5) give the 'Go' command (after the hover command?)
6) after the 10 seconds (or whatever the time is) + 2 or 3 seconds (to allow them to settle) give the land command



NOTE: The drone's won't avoid collisions, so run this in simulation mode first (--sim parameter) to make sure they don't crash.
